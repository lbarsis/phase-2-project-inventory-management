# Inventory Management Summary

There are four tabs in the navigational tool bar: Home, Inventory, Add Item, and On Order. Home offers brief directions on how the application can be used. Inventory is the bulk of the application that shows the user the full stock of items in inventory and items that need to be reordered. Add Item page is used to add new items to the database. The On Order page shows a consilidated list of all the items that are low in stock.
